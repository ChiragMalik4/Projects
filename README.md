# Chat Website - Pixelated Theme

The Chat Website features a pixelated theme with the main focus on backend development using PHP. The frontend design having a quirky appearance is intentional and diverging from a professional feel because it was a personal project for learning.

### Features:

1. **Registration and Login:** Provides user authentication for secure access to the chat platform.
   
2. **Browser Token System:** Implements a token-based system to keep users logged in until they choose to log out, enhancing user convenience.
   
3. **Friend Requests:** Users can send friend requests by typing the recipient's user ID in the search box. 

4. **Friend Management:** Allows users to accept or reject friend requests received from others.
   
5. **Real-time Chat:** Enables real-time communication between users, enhancing the interactive experience.
